### Example Configurations

#### Basic Configuration
```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.steam_activity
title: Steam Gaming Activity
```

#### Binary/Habit Tracking Mode
Perfect for tracking habits like gym attendance, medication, or any yes/no daily activity:

```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: input_boolean.gym_tracker
title: Gym Activity
binary_mode: true
binary_on_state: "on"
binary_color: "#4CAF50"
```

In binary mode:
- Days are shown as either active (colored) or inactive (gray)
- The detail panel shows "X / Y days (Z% active)" instead of duration
- Clicking a day shows "Active" or "No activity" with a list of states that occurred

## Theming

The Calendar Heatmap Card features advanced theme-aware color handling that automatically adapts to your Home Assistant theme. The card will detect whether you're using a light or dark theme and adjust colors accordingly for optimal visibility.

### Theme Detection

In version 3.3.0, the theme detection has been improved to:

1. Automatically detect theme changes in real-time
2. Properly detect themes from parent elements (useful for cards inside dashboards with different themes)
3. Adapt colors for better contrast in both light and dark themes

### Visual Differentiation

The card uses an improved intensity scaling algorithm that provides better visual differentiation between different activity durations:

- Very short sessions (< 15 min)
- Short sessions (15-45 min)
- Medium sessions (45 min - 2 hours)
- Longer sessions (2-4 hours)
- High usage sessions (4-8 hours)
- Very high usage sessions (8+ hours)

This makes it easier to distinguish between days with different levels of activity at a glance.

## Entity Requirements

This card works best with entities that:

1. Have different states representing different activities (like game names)
2. Change state frequently enough to generate meaningful data
3. Maintain history in Home Assistant

Examples include:
- Game activity sensors (Steam, PlayStation, etc.)
- Device usage sensors
- Presence/occupancy sensors
- Any sensor that changes state throughout the day

## Integration Examples

### Discord Game Activity

The Calendar Heatmap Card works perfectly with the [Discord Game integration](https://github.com/LordBoos/discord_game) for Home Assistant, which provides a sensor that tracks the games you play.

When you set up the Discord Game integration, it creates a sensor for each user that shows the current game being played. The sensor follows the format `sensor.discord_user_*_game` where `*` is your Discord user ID. This sensor's state changes to the name of the game when you're playing something, and to "idle", "offline", or other status indicators when you're not.

#### Example Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:calendar-heatmap-card
entity: sensor.discord_user_game
title: My Discord Gaming Activity
days_to_show: 365
ignored_states:
  - unknown
  - idle
  - offline
  - ""
  - dnd
  - online
refresh_interval: 300
start_day_of_week: monday
```

Replace `sensor.discord_user_game` with your actual Discord game sensor as it appears in Home Assistant.

#### How It Works

The Calendar Heatmap Card will:
- Track the time spent in each game state
- Display different colors for different games
- Show a breakdown of your gaming activity when you hover over or click on a day
- Filter out states like "idle" and "offline" by default (configurable)

This gives you a beautiful visualization of your gaming habits over time, showing which days you played the most and which games dominated your play time.
